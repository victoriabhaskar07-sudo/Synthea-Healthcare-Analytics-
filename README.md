# Synthea Healthcare Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes synthetic electronic health record (EHR) data from Synthea (1,000+ patients, 10,000+ encounters) to uncover insights into patient demographics, clinical conditions, and operational metrics. The goal is to demonstrate data extraction, transformation, and visualization skills using SQL and Power BI.

## Tools Used
- **SQL (MySQL)** – data extraction, cleaning, and analysis
- **Power BI** – data modeling, DAX measures, interactive dashboards

## Key Insights
- **14% overall readmission rate**, with patients 65+ having twice the rate (20%).
- Cardiology had the highest cost impact at ₹21 lakh.
- Emergency encounters account for 30% of all visits but 45% of total costs.
- Top 3 diagnoses: Hypertension, Diabetes, Acute bronchitis.

## Files
- `/sql` – SQL queries used for data extraction and analysis.
- `/dashboard` – Power BI dashboard file and screenshots.
